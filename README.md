## Usage



## Middleware

The `_middleware.ts` file handles the authentication logic. It checks if the user is logged in by verifying the presence of a Supabase token in the cookies. If the token is valid, the user can access protected routes.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, you can use Deno Deploy or any other platform that supports Deno. Ensure your environment variables are set up correctly in the deployment environment.
